            Brewgr is now open source software!
        </h3>

        <p>
            The homebrew software that runs beerrecipe.ca is now open source. We hope that passionate developers out
            there will help us work on it so that it can continue to grow and serve as a valuable tool
            to the homebrew community.
        </p>
