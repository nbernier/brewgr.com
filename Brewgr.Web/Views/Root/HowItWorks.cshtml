                        Add your ingredients, fermentables, hops, yeast, and extra ingredients to the homebrew recipe calculator.
                        All values are completly customizable to match your local ingredients. Give your homebrew a name and a few
                        equipment measurements; batch size, boil size, etc. You are also able to add a description and upload an
                        image of your homebrew.
