                The Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) is a non profit organization that was formed in the 80's and exists to promote and educate on the appreciation of real beer.  Along with
                certification of BJCP judges, the BJCP also clearly defines 28 beer styles and many sub-styles.  Homebrewers can use the BJCP style guidelines to make homebrew beer that falls into these
                styles. For more information on Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) and the BJCP style guidlines, visit BJCP online at <a href="http://www.bjcp.org">http://www.bjcp.org</a>.

                Some homebrewers make homebrew recipes that don't conform to the exact guidelines of the BJCP styles.  It is also common for homebrewers to not
                select a style when entering their recipes into the homebrew recipe calculator.  Just because these homebrew recipes are not assigned to a specific style
                doesn't mean they aren't great recipes and we don't want you to miss them.
