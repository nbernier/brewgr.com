                    The addition of more hops is key in an Imperial IPA which leads
                    to increased bitterness, super hoppy aromas and unique flavors.  The added
                    bitterness from the hops is balanced through the use of more malts causing these beers
                    to be much stronger and higher in alcohol content.  The Imperial IPA style continues to
                    be one of the most popular styles for homebrewers with Imperial IPA recipes that continue
                    to push the limits of the style.
